#### Project name: Thirdbnb - A Blockchain-based Airbnb contender DEFI/NFT platfom: 

### Project Description
- A Blockchain-based Airbnb contender. Decentralized platform for the home-sharing short and long-term stays using cryptocurrency payment methods. Giving hosts and guests more control, ownership, and lower fees on the Blockchain

#### Let understand the problem we solving:
- High fees - existing Bnb charge very high fees for booking cost.
- Centralized and controlled communications - loss of direct host-guest relationships
- Transactional processes, not relationships - a shift from encouraging high-value, peer-to-peer relationships to transactional ones
- Lower levels of trust - trust between hosts and guests, as well as towards the platforms themselves
- Payment options
