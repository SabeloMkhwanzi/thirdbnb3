## Project name: Thirdbnb - A Blockchain-based Airbnb contender DEFI/NFT platform

#### Let understand the problem we solving

- High fees - existing Bnb charge very high fees for booking cost.
- Centralized and controlled communications - loss of direct host-guest relationships
- Transactional processes, not relationships - a shift from encouraging high-value, peer-to-peer relationships to transactional ones
